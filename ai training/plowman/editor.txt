Shark Drawing Program Documentation

Explanation of the Libraries Used:

The following libraries are used in the code:





cairo 



math

Cairo is an open-source graphics library that provides a vector graphics-based API that is device-independent.

Math is a module used specifically for mathematical operations like calculating pi.

Saving the Picture:

The program saves the picture as a PNG file named "shark.png" using the surface.write_to_png() method. This method writes the contents of the surface to a PNG file.

Functions Used to Create Geometric Shapes:

The program uses various cairo functions to create geometric shapes:





context.rectangle(): Adds a closed sub-path rectangle of the given size to the current path at position (x , y ) in user-space coordinates.



context.curve_to(): Adds a cubic BÃ©zier spline to the path from the current point to position (x3 , y3 ) in user-space coordinates, using (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) as the control points.



context.move_to(): Begins a new sub-path - moves the current point to a new position. 



context.line_to(): Adds a line to the path from the current point to position (x , y ) in user-space coordinates.



context.close_path(): Adds a line segment to the path from the current point to the beginning of the current sub-path, (the most recent point passed to cairo_move_to()), and closes this sub-path.



context.fill(): A drawing operator that fills the current path according to the current fill rule.



context.stroke(): A drawing operator that strokes the current path according to the current line width, line join, line cap, and dash settings.



context.arc(): Adds a circular arc of the given radius to the current path.

Colors Used (HEX codes):

The program uses the following colors:





#87CFFA: Sky blue (used for background color)



#999999: Medium Gray (used for shark body color)



#000000: Black (used for outline and details)



#808080: Gray (used for both fins and tail)



#FFFFFF: White (used for eye highlight)

Geometric Shapes Used:

The program uses the following geometric shapes to create the shark image:





Rectangle: Used for the background.



Curves: Used for the shark body.



Triangles: An upward-pointing large triangle is used for the dorsal fin, and a downward-pointing large triangle is used for the ventral fin. Two triangles are used for the tail - a large left-pointing one touching the body on the rightmost point, and a small left-pointing one overlapping the middle of the right side of the large triangle by about one-third of its height.



Lines: Used for the shark's gills.



Arcs: Used for the shark's eye and mouth.



Circles: Used for the shark's eye and pupil.

These shapes are combined and positioned to create the final shark drawing.

In summation, the image is:

Simple: The use of basic shapes and shading keeps the drawing clean.

Approachable: The drawing is easy for the audience to grasp and can be used as an educational tool to encourage programmatic drawing.

Friendly: The illustration's use of a smile depicts the shark favorably, possibly destigmatizing the common myth that sharks are dangerous.

Each shape is carefully positioned and sized to create a visually appealing shark drawing.
