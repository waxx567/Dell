Shark Drawing Program Documentation

Explanation of the Libraries Used:

The following libraries are used in the code:

cairo
math

Saving the Picture:

The program saves the picture as a PNG file named "shark.png" using the surface.write_to_png() method. This method writes the contents of the cairo surface to a PNG file.

Functions Used to Create Geometric Shapes:

The program uses various cairo functions to create geometric shapes:

context.rectangle(): Creates a rectangle.

context.curve_to(): Creates a curve.

context.move_to(): Moves the current point to a new position.

context.line_to(): Creates a line from the current point to a new position.

context.close_path(): Closes the current path.

context.fill(): Fills the current path with the current source color.

context.stroke(): Strokes the current path with the current source color.

context.arc(): Creates an arc.

Colors Used (HEX codes):

The program uses the following colors:

#87CEEB (0.53, 0.81, 0.98): Sky blue (background color)

#999999 (0.6, 0.6, 0.6): Gray (shark body color)

#000000 (0, 0, 0): Black (outline and details)

#808080 (0.5, 0.5, 0.5): Dark gray (fins and tail)

#FFFFFF (1, 1, 1): White (eye highlight)

Geometric Shapes Used:

The program uses the following geometric shapes to create the shark image:

Rectangle: Used for the background.

Curves: Used for the shark body.

Triangles: Used for the fins and tail.

Lines: Used for the shark's gills and mouth.

Arcs: Used for the shark's eye and mouth.

Circles: Used for the shark's eye and pupil.

Each shape is used to represent a specific part of the shark:

Shark body: Curves

Fins: Triangles

Tail: Triangle

Gills: Lines

Mouth: Arc

Eye: Circle

Pupil: Circle

Eye highlight: Circle

These shapes are combined and positioned to create the final shark drawing.
