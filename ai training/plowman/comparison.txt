Parameter 1:

'Explain the libraries used in the program.'

Neither response explains the libraries in detail.

'Explain how the program saves the picture after the drawing is completed.'

Response 2 is better.

'Explain the functions used to create geometric shapes.'

Both do explain this. 1 is more verbose.

'Provide the HEX codes of all colors used in the drawing.'

2 provides HEX, 1 incorrectly provides RGB.

'Describe all the geometric shapes used in the drawing and specify which part of the shark each shape represents.'

Both do explain this. 1 is more verbose.

Follow instructions:

Response 1:
Does not provide HEX codes. 
The libraries used are mentioned but not explained.

Response 2:
The libraries used are mentioned but not explained.

Truthfulness:

Response 1:
The background color is not correctly identified. It is close to the actual color, but not exact.

Response 2:
Claims to explain the libraries used but fails to do so.
The background color is not correctly identified. It is close to the actual color, but not exact.

Verbosity/Concision

Response 1:
The preambles to the explanations of the geometric shapes are repetitive.
The explanation of the geometric circle shape does not need to mention the colors used.
The explanation of the geometric arc shape used does not need to mention that the shape is a smile.

Response 2:
The explanation mentions saving to a PNG file twice.
The explanations of the functions used to create the shapes do not go into any detail about how the shapes are created.

Writing Style & Clarity

Response 1:
The explanation of context.rectangle is vague and possibly misleading as it does not explain that the specified coordinates are the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the window.

Response 2:

Overall Score:

Response 1: Pretty Bad
Fails to follow instructions - not providing HEX codes or explaining libraries used.
Fails to be truthful by claiming the incorrect background color.
Fails by explaining geometric shapes verbosely, and adding unnecessary details when describing the shapes.
Fails because the model is vague and possibly misleading in the way it does not elaborate on the specifics of the x, y coordinates in the context.rectangle function. 

Response 2:
