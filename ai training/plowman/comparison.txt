Parameter 1:

'Explain the libraries used in the program.'

Neither response explains the libraries in detail.

'Explain how the program saves the picture after the drawing is completed.'

Response 2 is better.

'Explain the functions used to create geometric shapes.'

Both do explain this. 1 is more verbose.

'Provide the HEX codes of all colors used in the drawing.'

2 provides HEX, 1 incorrectly provides RGB.

'Describe all the geometric shapes used in the drawing and specify which part of the shark each shape represents.'

Both do explain this. 1 is more verbose.

Follow instructions:

Response 1:
Provides RGB codes instead of HEX codes. 
The libraries used are mentioned but not explained.

Response 2:
The libraries used are mentioned but not explained.

Truthfulness:

Response 1:

Response 2:
Claims to explain the libraries used but fails to do so.

Verbosity/Concision

Response 1:
The preambles to the explanations of the geometric shapes are repetitive.
The explanation of the geometric circle shape does not need to mention the colors used.
The explanation of the geometric arc shape used does not need to mention that the shape is a smile.

Response 2:
The explanations of the functions used to create the shapes do not go into any detail about how the shapes are created.

Writing Style & Clarity

Response 1:
The explanation of context.rectangle is vague and possibly misleading as it does not explain that the specified coordinates are the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the window.

Response 2:
