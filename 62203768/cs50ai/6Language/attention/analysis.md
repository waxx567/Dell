# Analysis

*You should describe at least two attention heads for which you’ve identified some relationship between words that the attention head appears to have learned. In each case, write a sentence or two describing what the head appears to be paying attention to and give at least two example sentences that you fed into the model in order to reach your conclusion.*

*The “Understanding” section of this project specification includes two examples for you: Layer 3, Head 10 where tokens appear to pay attention to the tokens that follow them; and Layer 4, Head 11 where adverbs appear to pay attention to the verbs they modify. The aspects of language you identify should be different from these two.*

*Attention heads can be noisy, so they won’t always have clear human interpretations. Sometimes they may attend to more than just the relationship you describe, and sometimes they won’t identify the relationship you describe for every sentence. That’s okay! The goal here is to make inferences about attention based on our human intuition for language, not necessarily to identify exactly what each attention head’s role is.*

*You can look for any relationship between words you’re interested in. If looking for ideas, you might consider any of the following: the relationship between verbs and their direct objects, prepositions, pronouns, adjectives, determiners, or tokens paying attention to the tokens that precede them.*
