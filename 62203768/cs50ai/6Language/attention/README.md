# Notes on Project 6: Attention
[Link](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/6/attention/)

Write an AI to predict a masked word in a text sequence.

$ python mask.py
Text: We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small field.
We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small clearing.
We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small park.

$ python mask.py
Text: Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table.
Then I picked up a book from the table.
Then I picked up a bottle from the table.
Then I picked up a plate from the table.

# Background

One way to create language models is to build a Masked Language Model, where a language model is trained to predict a “masked” word that is missing from a sequence of text. BERT is a transformer-based language model developed by Google, and it was trained with this approach: the language model was trained to predict a masked word based on the surrounding context words.

BERT uses a transformer architecture and therefore uses an attention mechanism for understanding language. In the base BERT model, the transformer uses 12 layers, where each layer has 12 self-attention heads, for a total of 144 self-attention heads.

This project will involve two parts:

First, we’ll use the transformers Python library, developed by AI software company Hugging Face, to write a program that uses BERT to predict masked words. The program will also generate diagrams visualizing attention scores, with one diagram generated for each of the 144 attention heads.

Second, we’ll analyze the diagrams generated by our program to try to understand what BERT’s attention heads might be paying attention to as it attempts to understand our natural language.
