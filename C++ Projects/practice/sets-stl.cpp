Sets are a part of the C++ STL. Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order. 

Input Format

The first line of the input contains Q where Q is the number of queries. The next Q lines contain 1 query each. Each query consists of two integers y and z where z is the type of the query and  is an integer.

Output Format

For queries of type 3 print "Yes"(without quotes) if the number z is present in the set and if the number is not present, then print "No"(without quotes).
Each query of type 3 should be printed in a new line.

Sample Input

1 9
1 6
1 10
1 4
3 6
3 14
