Consider an n-element array, a, where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of k^i integers (where the value of k^i varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where i denotes an index in array a and j denotes an index in the array located at a[i]. For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location a[i] on a new line.

int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
    return 0;
