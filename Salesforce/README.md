Most developers who work with Salesforce technologies build custom business apps and solutions. They do this either with the Salesforce Platform (including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Data Cloud, and Experience Cloud communities) or with Heroku. While some developers specialize, most fit the description of full-stack developers working with both back-end logic and front-end experiences.
