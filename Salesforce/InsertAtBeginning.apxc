public class InsertAtBeginning {
    /*
    Apex practice problem #111
    Implement a method that would take an element and a List of elements as arguments and return the same List with the element inserted at the 0th position.
    For example, executing the snippet below:
    List<String> cities = new List<String> {
    'Seattle',
    'Cairo',
    'London'
    };
    insertAtStart('Mumbai', cities);
    should modify cities to have the following 4 values: ['Mumbai', 'Seattle', 'Cairo', 'London']
    You are required to modify the list that is passed. Try doing so without creating any extra lists, which would mean an O(1) space complexity.
    Hint: Insert the element at the 0th position and shift all the elements to the next position.
    Hint: Use set method to modify elements at existing position.
    Hint: When you come to the last element use >add method of the List.

        } else {
            cities.add(0, cityName);
        }
